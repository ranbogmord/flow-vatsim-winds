# P42 Flow Vatsim Winds widget

Small widget that fetches the latest METAR from VATSIM every 15 minutes and updates the in-sim weather with the required weather settings for VATSIM:
- Wind direction
- Wind velocity
- Temperature
- Pressure

For use when you want to fly on VATSIM with a specific weather preset (for example, VMC when the real wx is IMC). Do not use this with Live Weather.

It will also fetch winds aloft from https://open-meteo.com (can be disabled in the settings).
You can also scale down the wind velocity by a percentage (value set to 50 = half the wind velocity).

Installation
Unzip into your community folder. You'll find it under the Utilities section.

Requires Flow Pro by //42
